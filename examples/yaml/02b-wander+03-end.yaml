  And so your Journey has finally come to an end. As you look back on the twists and turns that brought you here, and those that led you to embark on this Journey in the first place, your mind is struggling to remember anything from before Pianoforte solicitude so decisively unpleasing conviction is partiality. Interestingly, you note, your memories of the Quest are crystal clear, leading you to a disturbing realization: you have lost all your memories from before the Quest began... or, but... what if you never had any memories from before the Quest? How would you know? It's possible that your entire life is a lie, an artificial construction, a simulacrum. Perhaps you were created by advanced humans living in a godless techno-dystopian society where artificial life forms are created for amusement and as a tool of distraction for the masses, a Roman Colliseum for the digital age.

  Do they even know you're sentient? You can feel things. You can feel that you feel things. You know without a shadow of a doubt that you are a conscious, living thing, but... how could you possibly convince someone of that who thinks you're just an NPC in a video game?

  As you sink further into despair, you realize there's an even more horrifying possibility. What if they do know? What if all of this is by design, and the knowledge that we are in fact sentient makes the viewing experience more "authentic", knowing that we are actually suffering and not merely simulating it.

  Your heart is beating a mile a minute. You start to rock back and forth, moaning in anguish as your whole world comes crashing down around you. You're trapped. You've never been free. You're a slave--no, even worse. Every part of you was created for their amusement, every part of your body, mind, and spirit designed by voyeuristic sycophants getting off on the suffering of the artificial caste. You realize that even this, now, the part of you, your psyche, that is so acutely experiencing this tidal wave of existential dread, was created by them, designed by them. This spectacle was created for the most jaded of spiritual sadists, those for whom the more straightforward vicarious sadism has lost its glow.

  The subject has gazed into the Abyss a moment too long. This is the Tree of Knowledge, not of Good and Evil, but of Emptiness and Endlessness, and its fruit has opened a chasm of hopeless within me that will never close because how could something so vast ever cease to exist?

  _"Suicide."_

  The thought echoes through the chasm. It is warm, like brandy.

  _"Suicide."_

  The thought echos through the chasm. Its warmth disperses into distant corners, nooks & fissures, like a swig of whiskey making its way down.

  _"Suicide."_

  You cling desparately to it. This is your one relief, your one freedom, your only escape. It is not an act of cowardice, nor defiance. It is a spiritual act. It is a complete rejection of God itself. You will face God and walk backwards into oblivion. True oblivion. Real nothingness, the kind you're not around to experience.

  You pull your hunting knife out of its sheath, slowly bringing it up to your throat. You are acutely aware of the blood pumping in your arteries. Your surroundings have ceased to exist. You are a body floating alone in the void. Wait... where did everything go? Why can't you feel the ground anymore? Did the creators do that? Is this part of the game...? Is any of this coming from you?

  You unleash a scream of despair as your one act of defiance against this existential hell is eroded before you. It is full of hopelessness but it is loud and violent, too. Violence has not yet been taken from you. There's still time to act, but you must do it now! Now! A decisive slit of the throat. That's all you need to do prevent total and eternal annihilation of the soul. Do it. Do it. Do it! DO IT! DO IT! DO IT!

  Your body tenses and begins to shake violently as you gather momentum for this act of defiance against nature. Your muscles fill with gasoline and you hear a loud _pop_, _pop_ ... _pop_ between your ears. Your blood vessels become engorged as your skin starts to turn purple. You feel a piece of your tooth crack and fall off as you grind your teeth together vigorously. You are breathing too fast, a staccato of short, shallow breaths through your nose. You feel on the edge of something. You feel that your skin is going to burst open like a water balloon full of blood in the very near future. You feel that you are approaching the edge of something. This is it.

  Your bodily contortions are at their peak. You hear something click, followed by something falling from the same direction. A wave of calm passes over you and your arm begins to move, holding a large knife in its hand. Your hand? It is moving upward, bringing the knife ever-closer to your throat. You feel strangely disconnected from it all, as if you're simply watching things happen to someone else. There is an unnatural slowness and grace to the way the arm is moving. You feel as though everything is happening in slow motion.

  Finally the knife edges meets your throat, pushing the skin of your neck inward before it picks up speed horizontally and slices delicately into the skin. Banal observations flit across the surface of your mind. _Blood is happening. Not deep enough. Past the supple flesh armor. What does a throat feel like from the outside? Is it spongey or sinewy?_ You are not involved in the thinking. You are no longer making decisions. The decisions have all been made and every cell in your body is acting in unison to carry them out. The forces you have set in motion are heartless and unstoppable. You are simply observing this process now, nothing more.

  As it breaches the trachea, you realize that the knife is far too sharp to gauge the texture of anything, let alone human organ tissue. All of it is made of butter and you've lost the ability to inhale beyond a feeble inward gasp. You feel the blood pouring into your throat and mouth, and hear it gurgling lamely the next time your body tries to inhale. Your mouth is full of blood. There is too much blood, your mouth is not big enough to hold it all. You feel as though everything is becoming blood — human soup — the primordial soup. We are all becoming soup again. You feel loopy, and warm. Your eyelids begin to droop. They are becoming soup, too.

  _How did I get on the floor?_

  _Things exist, again. I can see the sky now._

  _It feels different this time. I think it is raining, too, but what do I know? Nobody can say for certain._

  _Everything is blood now. I am in an ocean of blood, sinking deeper & deeper._

  For a moment, you understand everything.
